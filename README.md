# Question: How can you merge overlapping intervals in a list? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `mergeIntervals` is designed to merge overlapping intervals in a list. The function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, it returns the empty list. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the intervals in ascending order based on their starting times. It then initializes the first interval as the previous interval and adds it to the result list. The function then iterates over the sorted intervals. For each current interval, if its start time is less than or equal to the end time of the previous interval, it means the two intervals overlap. In this case, the function merges the two intervals by updating the end time of the previous interval to be the maximum of the end times of the two overlapping intervals. If the current interval does not overlap with the previous interval, the function adds the current interval to the result list and updates the previous interval to be the current interval. The function continues this process until all intervals have been processed, and finally returns the result list which contains the merged intervals.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and flow. Both versions sort the intervals by their starting times and then iterate over the sorted intervals, merging any that overlap and adding the merged intervals to a new array.

However, there are a few key differences between the two versions:

1. TypeScript uses static types: In the TypeScript version, the `Interval` class is defined with `start` and `end` properties, both of which are of type `number`. The `mergeIntervals` function is also explicitly typed to accept an array of `Interval` objects and return an array of `Interval` objects. This provides better type safety and can help prevent bugs related to incorrect data types.

2. Use of classes: The TypeScript version uses a class `Interval` to represent an interval with a start and end. This provides a more structured and object-oriented approach to representing the data.

3. Different way of handling intervals: In the JavaScript version, intervals are represented as arrays of two numbers. In the TypeScript version, intervals are represented as instances of the `Interval` class. This makes the TypeScript version more readable and easier to understand, as it's clear that each interval has a `start` and `end`.

4. Different way of printing the result: In the JavaScript version, the result is printed directly by calling `console.log` on the result of `mergeIntervals`. In the TypeScript version, the result is iterated over with a `for...of` loop, and each interval is printed individually. This makes the TypeScript version more flexible, as it allows for custom formatting of the output.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version. Both versions first sort the intervals based on the start time, then iterate over the sorted intervals to merge overlapping ones. 

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax:

1. Data Structure: In JavaScript, intervals are represented as arrays of two elements. In C++, a struct is used to represent an interval with two integer members, start and end.

2. Sorting: JavaScript uses the built-in sort function with a custom comparator function that subtracts the start times of two intervals. C++ also uses the built-in sort function from the algorithm library, but it requires a separate comparator function (intervalCompare) to compare the start times of two intervals.

3. Iteration: JavaScript uses a for-of loop to iterate over the intervals, while C++ uses a traditional for loop with an index.

4. Output: The JavaScript version simply returns the result array, while the C++ version prints out the merged intervals in the main function.

5. Memory Management: In C++, the merged intervals are stored in a vector that is returned by value from the mergeIntervals function. This means that a copy of the vector is created when the function returns. In JavaScript, arrays (and objects in general) are always handled by reference, so no copying occurs when the function returns.

6. Type Safety: C++ is a statically typed language, so the types of all variables must be declared upfront. JavaScript is dynamically typed, so variables can hold values of any type.
